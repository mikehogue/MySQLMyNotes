The extra credit features that we implemented are detailed on the
`Features.jsp` page, available at `/MyNotes/JSP/Features.jsp`, and are also
included below for reference.

The files that we added in the `MyNotes` directory are:
    header.jsp            - Common header partial used on all pages
    index.jsp             - Changed to a JSP to make it more robust
    JSP/AddBoard.jsp      - Extra feature to add a board
    JSP/Features.jsp      - Explains the extra features that we've implemented
    JSP/Subscribe.jsp     - List subscriptions and subcribe to a board
    sql_scripts/          - Directory with all the SQL scripts
    sql_scripts/login.sql - Automatically runs destroy, create, and populate
                            when you login to `sqlpl` in that directory

All of the extra technologies that we used are client-side:
    Foundation, jQuery, and Select2


We hope you like it!


======================== Information from Features.jsp =========================

Style
    The whole site has been styled using the Foundation framework.

Client-side Validation
    Basic validation is done client-side when possible (as well as
    server-side). An example of this is on the Add Profile Information page
    where the email field helps ensure that a valid email address is entered.

Improved Forms
    All of the forms have been updated to use the most appropriate HTML input
    types. A good example of this is on the Add Card page. The Description
    field is now a textarea to allow easier multi-line input. Date is a date
    input type which displays a gui datepicker on supporting browsers like
    Chrome. This validates the user's date input and makes it quicker and
    easier to enter.

Working Logout
    We've made it possible to logout of the system, removing the user's
    credentials from the session. Trying to access any vital page while not
    logged in will redirect the user back to the login screen.

Add Board
    We've made it possible to add a board to the system. It handles various
    error situations such as not being logged in, trying to insert a board with
    an empty name, or trying to insert a board that already exists.

Subscribe to a Board
    We've made it possible to subscribe to a board. The page also lists all of
    the boards that the current user is subscribed to. It handles error
    situations like trying to subscribe to a board that doesn't exist or to one
    that is already subscribed to.

Show user name in title
    Take a look at the title of various pages (such as the main menu) to see
    the name of the current user. The login page is also smart enough to
    determine if a user is already logged in and will display a greeting if
    they are.

Persistent header and navigation
    There is a consistent header across all pages that includes navigation
    links and a logout button. The code for the header was modularized and put
    into a header.jsp file that is included in every page. This allows for a
    consistent look between pages, extremely easy navigation, and makes changes
    easier to implement. The site title can be clicked to return to the login
    page. Irrelevant buttons are hidden on certain pages, such as the logout
    button on the login page when the user is not logged in.

Board Name Autocomplete
    The Board Name inputs on Add Card and Subscribe feature auto-completing
    selection dropdowns. The one on Subscribe only shows the boards that the
    user is not already subscribed to.

Features Page
    This very page is included to help graders find the extra features that
    we've implemented.
